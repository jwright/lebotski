  long_description: "Hey man, this bot really ties Slack together.\r

    \r

    I'm Lebotski, so that's what you call me. Or The Bot, or El Botness if you're not into that whole brevity thing.\r

    \r

    There is not a lot of in's or out's to this app, man. I am pretty housebroken.\r

    \r

    Obviously, you're a worker so I can help you can find some far-out places to hang after work that are not private residences. What day is it?\r

    \r

    You can find the following in any location:\r

    \r

    * Dispensaries\r

    * Bowling Alleys\r

    * Cocktail Bars\r

    \r

    Pretty cool man.\r

    \r

    There are some rules, this isn't 'Nam. For each different place, there is a different command to find them.\r

    \r

    You can't be worrying about where to find sh*t. Life goes on, man."
